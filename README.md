# FAKE-CURRENCY-DETECTION USING MATLAB

# Project Overview
Counterfeit currency is a major economic concern, leading to financial losses and fraud. This project introduces an Automated Fake Currency Detection System using MATLAB and Image Processing techniques. The system analyzes currency notes, extracts key security features, and compares them against a database of genuine notes to determine authenticity.

#  Features
- Automated currency verification using image processing  
- Feature extraction with the MSER (Maximally Stable Extremal Regions) algorithm  
- Edge detection using Canny and Prewitt filters  
- Histogram analysis for accurate comparison  
- GUI-based interactive detection system

# How It Works
1. Upload an image of a currency note.
2. The system processes the image by:
   - Converting it to grayscale
   - Segmenting key areas of the note
   - Extracting security features
   - Detecting edges and patterns
3. Comparison with a reference database of real notes.
4. Classification: The system determines if the currency is real or fake.
5. The result is displayed in the GUI.
